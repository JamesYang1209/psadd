# phyloseq additions

This package contains customs functions and additions to the [phyloseq](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq) package.
Instead of sharing functions scripts, I bundled functions and their documentation into this package for the sake of clarity and re-usability.

# Installation

The `psadd` installation requires [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html). 
Paste the following lines to both check for `devtools` and install `psadd`.

```r
if( !  require(devtools) ){ install.packages("devtools") }
library(devtools)
install_github("cpauvert/psadd")
```
